          <h3>Who I <span class="text-primary"> Am? </span> </h3>
          <p>Hey, my name is Joshua Lewis. I am 19 years old and was born and raised in a small town
            called Saint Rose, Louisiana. I completed the majority of my schooling in Louisiana,
            but in my senior year of high school, I moved to Heath, Texas. I think this move fits
            my personality as I love meeting new people and making new memories!</p>
        </div>
        <div class="what">
          <h3> What I <span class="text-primary"> Do? </span></h3>
          <p>I am currently a rising sophomore Computer Science major at Xavier University of
            Louisiana and am expected to graduate in May of 2023! I am a software mentor for a
            local FRC (Robotics) Team in my community as well as a tutor for some of my peers at
            Xavier. I also am currently working a Google this summer as a STEP intern which is
            one of the things I am most proud of!
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="why">
          <h3>Why I <span class="text-primary"> do it?</span> </h3>
          <p>I got into computer science because of Robotics during my freshman year of high-school
            and from that point on I've been obsessed with it. Seeing the code that I'm writing
            affecting a robot was something that never got old. My goal as I get further into my
            career is to work in the robotics health industry or the autonomous vehicle industry.
            This is because those are areas where a lot of people can be positively affected as well
            as an area that I truly enjoy working in. Of course with the future hopes of owning my
            own company!
