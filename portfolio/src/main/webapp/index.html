          <h3>Who I <span class="text-primary"> Am? </span> </h3>
          <p>Hey, my name is Joshua Lewis. I am 19 years old and was born and raised in a small town
            called Saint Rose, Louisiana. I completed the majority of my schooling in Louisiana,
            but in my senior year of high school, I moved to Heath, Texas. I think this move fits
            my personality as I love meeting new people and making new memories!</p>
        </div>
        <div class="what">
          <h3> What I <span class="text-primary"> Do? </span></h3>
          <p>I am currently a rising sophomore Computer Science major at Xavier University of
            Louisiana and am expected to graduate in May of 2023! I am a software mentor for a
            local FRC (Robotics) Team in my community as well as a tutor for some of my peers at
            Xavier. Also I am currently working at Google this summer as a STEP intern which is
            one of the things I am most proud of!
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="why">
          <h3>Why I <span class="text-primary"> do it?</span> </h3>
          <p>I got into computer science because of Robotics during my freshman year of high-school
            and from that point on I've been obsessed with it. Seeing the code that I write
            affect a robot was something that never got old. My goal as I get further into my
            career is to work in the robotics health industry or the autonomous vehicle industry.
            This is because those are areas where a lot of people can be positively affected as well
            as an area that I truly enjoy working in. My ultimate dream is to one day own my own company!

        <h3>Poke<span class="text-primary">Hood</span></h3>
        <div class="project-highlight">
            <p>PokeHood is a program that I designed along with two other partners for my Google CSSI final project.
              Designed in Processing Python, PokeHood has most of the basic features that would be present in an old
              pokemon game. For the project, I designed all of the in-game mechanics such as the world with character
              movements/animation and player to pokemon detection to initiate the battles. I also designed the battle
              screen logic such as type effectiveness and damage calculation.

        <h3>FIRST <span class="text-primary">Robotics</span></h3>
        <div class="project-highlight">
            <p>FIRST Robotics Competition is a global challenge that brings together over 8000 teams per year to face
                off in different games. In January teams gather to watch the game release which tells you the task your
                robot will need to perform to be able to compete. Then you get 6 weeks to build a robot that can
                complete those tasks at a high level. I was a member of FRC for all four years of high school and held
                the title of Lead Programmer for three of those four years. I not only learned about programming but
                also valuable team building and communication skills that I can carry for life. If you wanna learn more
