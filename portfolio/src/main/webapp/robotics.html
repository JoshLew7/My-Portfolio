                    <p>Hey, my name is Joshua Lewis. I am 19 years old and was born and raised in a small town
                        called Saint Rose, Louisiana. I completed the majority of my schooling in Louisiana,
                        but in my senior year of high school, I moved to Heath, Texas. I think this move fits
                        my personality as I love meeting new people and making new memories!</p>

                <div class="what">
                    <h3> What I <span class="text-primary"> Do? </span></h3>
                    <p>I am currently a rising sophomore Computer Science major at Xavier University of
                        Louisiana and am expected to graduate in May of 2023! I am a software mentor for a
                        local FRC (Robotics) Team in my community as well as a tutor for some of my peers at
                        Xavier. Also I am currently working at Google this summer as a STEP intern which is
                        one of the things I am most proud of!
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="why">
                    <h3>Why I <span class="text-primary"> do it?</span> </h3>
                    <p>I got into computer science because of Robotics during my freshman year of high-school
                        and from that point on I've been obsessed with it. Seeing the code that I write
                        affect a robot was something that never got old. My goal as I get further into my
                        career is to work in the robotics health industry or the autonomous vehicle industry.
                        This is because those are areas where a lot of people can be positively affected as well
                        as an area that I truly enjoy working in. My ultimate dream is to one day own my own company!
